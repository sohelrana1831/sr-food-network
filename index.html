          While Katie Lee makes Creamy Kale and Eggs for breakfast, the chefs
          discuss their New Year's resolutions. They also introduce and prepare
          delicious dishes to help viewers get dinner on the table. They debate
          the merits of several kitchen gadgets versus a good paring knife and
          Geoffrey Zakarian makes a Red Velvet Cocktail while the chefs dish on
          what they're "Into and Over" this week.

          Food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat,
          and other nutrients used in the body of an organism to sustain growth
          and vital processes and to furnish energy. The absorption and
          utilization of food by the body is fundamental to nutrition and is
          facilitated by digestion. Plants, which convert solar energy to food
          by photosynthesis, are the primary food source. Animals that feed on
          plants often serve as sources of food for other animals. To learn more
          about the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of
          food from organism to organism, see food chain.

        <p>
          In some areas, "fast" is a good thing. When it comes to improving your
          running or walking pace, completing a dreaded task or even losing
          weight (safely, of course)—well, the faster, the better. Fast traffic,
          fast money, fast meetings: all good. But when it comes to fast food?
          Not so much. We've all been in that situation when, strapped for time
          or lagging in energy, we give into the tempting convenience, quickness
          and maybe even the crave-worthy taste of a drive-thru meal. But the
          short-term rewards are quickly eclipsed by the nagging guilt of
          consuming food (and we use that term loosely) that, in most cases,
          provides little to no nutritive benefit and exceeds our allotment of
          calories, saturated fat, sodium and sugar. Let's face it: There's
          nothing fun about entering a Big Mac and fries into your Nutrition
          Tracker. That said, the occasional window pickup doesn't have to
          completely derail your progress, Sohel Rana

          Tasty vegetarian pasta recipes are among the best that pasta has to
          offer. Pasta on its own is always a delicious safe bet (especially now
          that there are plenty of alternatives to suit just about any dietary
          need). And from there it's almost impossible to go wrong by tossing
          some vegetables and other good stuff like fresh herbs into the mix.

          Whenever I find myself in a cooking rut, I turn to beet recipes. I can
          always count on ruby red beets—a hearty source of earthy sweetness,
          potassium, vitamin C, and fiber—to reinvigorate my diet and literally
          add a little color to my life. Speaking of which: Red beets, with
          their eye-catching signature hue, are the most common kind. Other
          varieties, like golden and pink striped .
